             </div>
             <p >It’s another football movie, this one with an even smaller role for Boseman. It’s Boseman’s first feature credit. The movie as a whole is a solid biopic. Following the life of Ernie Davis, it is a traditional inspirational film.
                Often it doesn’t transcend the cliches of the genre, but the performances alone are enough to elevate the film particularly from its lead, Rob Brown. It’s earnest and effective at the message it is trying to convey.</p>

               <h4> #4. 42 </h4>
         <p>A baseball icon, Jackie Robinson broke all kinds of barriers. Boseman plays Robinson in this biopic. Though the movie ultimately plays it a little safe, it’s fascinating none the less. Director Biran Helgeland never goes too deep,
           but does an admirable job of exploring the man and the incredible story around him. Harrison Ford is surprisingly solid as is the rest of the supporting cast. Robinson legacy is done with justice in this riveting portrait of an American story.</p>
